    <h2 id="section1">Introduction</h2>
    <p class="text">This page is an overview of the well-known style guides used by technical content creators all over the world. Each style guide serves as a valuable resource, consisting of a defined set of rules and recommendations. It encompasses various elements that contribute to the overall quality and consistency of the technical documents. These elements include tone, voice, format, and structure, among others.
      I provide concise descriptions of the guides and highlight their similarities and differences in terms of technical writing.

    <h2 id="section2">Microsoft Style Guide</h2>
    <p class="text">Microsoft Style Guide (MSG) is a comprehensive guide for writing and creating documentation, including technical content, user interfaces, and other Microsoft-related materials. It provides guidelines on grammar, punctuation, capitalization, tone, and more. The guide is primarily focused on Microsoft-specific products and technologies but is widely used as a standard for the technical content of different software products.
      MSG tips for writers who create content about technology are the following:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>To use bigger ideas, fewer words.</li>
        <li>To write like you speak.</li>
        <li>To project friendliness.</li>
        <li>To get to the point fast.</li> 
        <li>To be brief.</li>  
        <li>Not to capitalize when in doubt.</li> 
        <li>To skip periods (and : ! ?).</li> 
        <li>To remember the last comma.</li> 
        <li>Not to be spacey.</li>  
        <li>To revise weak writing.</li>
      </ul>
    <h2 id="section3">Apple Style Guide</h2>
    <p class="text">Apply Style Guide (ASG) tells us to use:</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="list">The American Heritage Dictionary</li>
          <li>The Chicago Manual of Style</li>
          <li>Words into Type</li>
        </ul>
      <p class="text"> ASG is based on the guidelines from the above resources. They have Apple documents for designers and writers when those deal with interfaces of different Apple products. <br>
      It offers editorial guidelines for the content used in Apple user interfaces, technical documentation, training programs, and reference materials to make sure everyone follows the brand voice.<br>
      ASG contains general guidelines for creating content such as:</p>
        <ul class="list">
        	<li>To think inclusively.</li>
          <li>To research words.</li>
          <li>To consider the context.</li>
          <li>To avoid idioms and colloquial expressions.</li> 
          <li>Not to use color to convey positive or negative qualities.</li>  
          <li>To avoid biases and stereotypes.</li> 
          <li>To use gender-neutral pronouns.</li> 
          <li>To be careful when writing about disabilities.</li> 
          <li>To read what you write.</li>

        </ul>
    <p class="text"> There is a list of words, phrases, and abbreviations that you can review before using them in the content you create (a certain number of those is Apple-specific.)

  <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Capitalization</b></td>
   <td>It offers to use sentence-style capitalization.</td>
   <td>Two styles of capitalization are commonly used at Apple:<br>
   		• Sentence-style capitalization<br>
   	  • Title-style capitalization</td>
   <td>Sentence case is the Google choice.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Select</b></td>
    <td><b>Select</b> is preferable for interactions with UI, for example:<br>
    • Selecting an item on a menu or shortcut menu. </td>
    <td>ASG suggests using different words for actions: choose, click, etc., for example:<br>
      • Use choose, not select, for menu items.</td>
    <td> GDSG suggests using <b>select</b> to describe choosing an item from among multiple options, selecting text, or marking a checkbox</td>
  </tr>

    <td>No information.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Numbers in dates</b></td>
    <td>Don't use ordinals.</td>
    <td>You can use ordinals when the month is not mentioned, full-size letters.</td>
    <td>No information about ordinals. Interesting that they recommend always using words to express dates. Expressing dates in numbers only (using slashes, periods, or hyphens as separators) can be confusing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Dropdown</b></td>
    <td>It's okay to use <b>dropdown menu</b>.</td>
    <td>Don't use <b>drop-down menu</b>, use <b>menu</b>.</td>
    <td> They say to use <b>drop-down</b>, not <b>dropdown</b> or <b>drop down</b>. In most cases, you can omit drop-down in favor of a list or menu.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>e-words</b></td>
    <td>Almost all e-words are hyphenated. <b>Email</b> is an exception. Always hyphenate <b>e-book</b>.</td>
    <td>Hyphenate terms using the short form: e-commerce, e-learning. Exceptions include <b>email</b> and <b>ebook</b>.</td>
    <td>Do not hyphenate. For example, use <b>ecommerce</b>, not <b>e-commerce</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Acronyms</b></td>
    <td>Spell for clarity, don't use once, lowercase.</td>
    <td>Spell for clarity, don't use once, lowercase, and add pronunciation key if the pronunciation is not evident.</td>
    <td>They say to use standard acronyms and initialisms that will save the reader time. Spell out abbreviations on the first reference.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Tap and hold</b></td>
    <td>Use only if required by the program to achieve a specific result. Don't use <b>touch and hold</b>.</td>
    <td>Don't use. Tap means to touch and release quickly, so use <b>touch and hold</b> instead.</td>
    <td> Suggests using <b>tap & hold</b> or <b>tap and hold</b>. However, not in Android documentation. Instead, they offer to use <b>touch & hold</b>. (Not touch and hold.).</td>

    <td><b>Uncheck, unmark, unselect</b></td>
    <td>Use <b>clear</b> instead.</td>

  <tr>
    <td><b>Username</b></td>
    <td>No information.</td>
    <td>Use <b>user name</b>.</td>
    <td>Use <b>username</b>, not <b>user name</b>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Whitelist</b></td>
    <td>Never use <b>whitelist</b>. Use <b>allowlist</b> or <b>safe senders list</b> instead.</td>
    <td>Don't use. For the noun, use an alternative that's appropriate to the context, such as <b>deny list</b> or <b>allow list</b>, <b>deny list</b> or <b>permit list</b>, and more.</td>
    <td>Possible when speaking about command or code. In other cases, don't use blacklist, whitelist, and graylist. 
      Instead, use more precise terms that are appropriate for the domain.
      For example, for the noun whitelist, consider using a replacement such as <b>allowlist</b>, <b>trustlist</b>, or <b>safelist</b>.</td>

   <p class="hr"></p>
   <div>
   	<p class="text">
   		To sum up, MSG has a more detailed and wholesome approach to creating content. It not only has the information available in ASG or GDSG but also contains:</p>
   		<ul>
   			<li>Explanation of their brand voice and tips to follow it.</li>
   			<li>Shares content planning, designing, and review recommendations.</li>
   			<li>Shares aspects of responsive and scannable content.</li>
   			<li>Dives into punctuations, grammar, and more.</li>
   		</ul>
     <p class="text">
      GDSG contains more recommendations for accessibility, code, programming, and speaks about timeless documentation.<br><br>
      Each guide brings its own unique insights and recommendations, providing alternative perspectives and solutions to various writing challenges. Moreover, when faced with uncertainties or specific content requirements, consulting various style guides can be immensely helpful. Different guides may offer specific guidance on topics like code formatting, terminology usage, or documentation structure that align more closely with the specific context in which the technical content is being developed. 
By studying and referencing different style guides, technical writers can broaden their knowledge and gain a more well-rounded understanding of effective writing practices.
